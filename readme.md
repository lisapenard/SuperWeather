*** WEATHER WEBSITE ***

Welcome to SuperWeather !

In order create a weather website, I decided to use three different APIs to make a complete website for it 
to be more likely to be intuitive and enjoyable for the users. 

My APIs : 
- OpenWeatherMap
- Weatherbit.io 
- Abalin Nameday

Each of the API has been used to do a different property of the website. 
- OpenWeatherMap has been used to recover the current weather 
- Weatherbit.io has been used to recover the forecast weather (5 days to come)
- Abalin Nameday has been used to recover the epiphany of the day and the 5 days to come, in association with 
the Weatherbit.io API to recover the date as well.

SuperWeather is structured with 3 pages : 
- The Homepage with all the information regarding weather 
- The Epiphany page regarding the different epiphanies 
- The Credits page to credit the APIs I used

My files : 
- index.php = contains the HomePage
- include.php = contains all the loop and function of the index.php
- epiphanies.php = contains the Epiphany Page
- credits.html = contains the Credits Page
- css.css = all the css of the index.php
- rest.css = all the css of the epiphanies.php and the credits.html

All the icons have been transformed thanks to the "switch" property. They are all stored in the images file. 
SuperWeather is responsive thanks to media queries. 

I hope you will enjoy it !
